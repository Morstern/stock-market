# stock-market
Version 2.0 from StockMarket (updated and modernized)

## Original repo
https://github.com/Morstern/StockMarket

## Why new repositorium instead of updating the old one
I wanted to show the way I modernized this project, first of all, structure of project has changed.

## Changes
- Directories are now categorized as "modules" instead of "functionality",
- I use more status codes which are proper for occuring situations and use header fields. (If-Match, Localization)

# WARNING: I still upgrade and continue this project
- it's not a full version of previous one, project lacks in functionality,
- I didn't write integration tests (yet).
